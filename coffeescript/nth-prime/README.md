# Nth Prime

Write a program that can tell you what the nth prime is.

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that
the 6th prime is 13.

If your language provides methods in the standard library to deal with prime
numbers, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

Refer to the [Exercism help page](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-coffeescript.html) for getting started with CoffeeScript.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called hello_world.spec.coffee, you can run the following command:
    jasmine-node --coffee hello_world.spec.coffee
